# Foxtrot-526
Repository to keep track of the different versions of the development of the game

#### Description:

Our basic game idea involves the player navigating through a maze, with areas being progressively revealed as the player units navigate through, and the rest of the maze “fogged up” or occluded as the players leave the area. The game environment is set up from a bird's eye perspective providing the top-down view of the maze.

As a player unit progresses, they need to make strategic decisions about the path to traverse and to overcome obstacles encountered in the path, to clear the level. When an enemy is encountered, the Interface changes to “Battle Mode”, where the player unit uses an attack slider to assault the monster. It would be a timing based attack, to kill the enemy and maximize the damage based on slider click timings. The player units score and total damage is monitored and the progress is carried forward to the next level. The goal is to cause maximum damage to the enemies in the current level, and gain XP to move on to the next level.
